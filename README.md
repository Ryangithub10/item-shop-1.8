# Item Shop1.8
Hei, it's a Item Shop Repo next version i make.

like the name, it is will show you a shop with RPG style and command line base.

and if you want see the current version, you can click [here](https://github.com/Ryangithub10/item-shop)

for the dcoder user, you can go to my [github](https://github.com/Ryangithub10) and follow me, beacause i will make a update in there, well i can make a update in direct to dcoder, but i can't be online continuously, and i usually making the update from remote github, so i hope you know why it's code not be finish, well in before i'm was make remote github to dcoder, but if i'm make a change in github/local to dcoder and otherwise, in dcoder/github no have change's at all.

so i hope you enjoy this repo/project dcoder/code i'm make, and i'm sorry if there is a typo or my grammar that is still wrong.

======**UPDATE**======

for the dcoder user, you don't to be wait for item shop update, beacuse actually it's was finished but i'm just to late for tell you it finished.
But, i'm want to add the sell future, for short; it's not finish actually. but after that, the item shop project will clear, trully clear! But you can fork it and make them more good than before.

okay that it so i hope you like my code and not asking again ‘Ryan, when the code finish?’
