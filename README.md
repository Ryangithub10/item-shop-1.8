# Item Shop2.0
Hei, it's a Item Shop Repo next version i make.

like the name, it is will show you a shop on RPG with command line base.

and if you want see the current version, you can click [here](https://github.com/Ryangithub10/item-shop)

for the dcoder user, you can go to my [github](https://github.com/Ryangithub10) and follow me, beacause i will make a update in there, well i can make a update in direct to dcoder, but i can't be online continuously, and i usually making the update form remote github, so i hope you know why it's code not be finish, well in before i'm was make remote github to dcoder, but if i'm make a change in github/local to dcoder and otherwise, in dcoder/github no have change's at all.

so i hope you enjoy this repo/project dcoder/code i'm make, and i'm sorry if there is a typo or my grammar that is still wrong.
